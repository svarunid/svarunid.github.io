# Arun's Journey (Intro)

I'm Arun S V, a 25-year-old who absolutely loves to code. I could do it all day and still love it. The whole journey started back in 8th grade when I first learned to develop websites out of pure curiosity. I had this simple motivation: I wanted myself to appear on the web when people navigated to arun.com. That one simple goal kept me going, and the journey made me learn more, do more, and ultimately brought me to where I am today.

Writing code has always felt as intuitive as math to me. You compose numbers with different operations and see the magic of math unfold. Similarly, you compose data with different operations and witness the magic of code. Both are equally fun and engaging.

## Education and College

I pursued computer science in high school and eventually became a CS graduate. College was a transformative experience for me. Everyone I met was interesting in their own way - they came from different backgrounds, each with unique experiences and skills. Being around them made me want to be more, to push my boundaries. I learned stuff, built things across the tech spectrum - websites, mobile apps, AI, you name it. I even mentored a group of juniors who later graduated with job offers that had higher salary packages than most of their peers. Those were fun times.

## Work Experience

### Junior Research Engineer at Buddi AI (1st Job)

My first job after graduation was an internship as a junior research engineer at Buddi AI. I was tasked with studying and improving the performance of a multi-label classifier model. The original plan was to build this full-fledged automated analytics platform that would analyze model results on a test-set, compare them with the training set, and report scenarios where the model excelled or failed. While I didn't manage to build that complete platform, I did create a solid pipeline that performed various analyses using different metrics. One thing I'm particularly proud of is implementing [adaptive label thresholding](https://svarunid.medium.com/adaptive-label-thresholding-994403ca4c19) - a novel way to find optimal threshold limits for each label. The intensity of work and the sheer amount of learning at Buddi AI was incredible. Unfortunately, the company ran into financial troubles, lost clients, and couldn't pay employees. I had to leave eventually.

### Software Engineer at AskEVA (2nd Job)

Next, I joined AskEVA, a small startup offering WhatsApp Business API solutions, as a software engineer. When I arrived, the company didn't have a strong tech team. Their product had potential but was plagued with serious flaws and bugs. Clients were constantly facing issues. I took the initiative to rebuild the entire backend infrastructure from scratch. I had to make tough calls, including letting go of people who couldn't keep pace with the speed and scale we needed. I owned everything end-to-end - from writing code to setting up infrastructure to deploying the product. The system I built was robust, smoothly handling thousands of requests per minute even under Meta's strict API rate limits. Beyond the technical work, I handled client communications too, patiently listening to their frustrations, documenting their pain points, and designing the system to serve their common use-cases better.

But eventually, I had to leave AskEVA. The work culture was problematic, and management kept making decisions I couldn't get behind. There were no plans to expand the team even as the product's complexity grew beyond what was manageable. We constantly disagreed about priorities - they wanted to keep adding features while I believed we needed to solidify the minimum viable product first (for me: retention > scaling). Frustratingly, I felt like my voice wasn't being heard and my ideas weren't taken seriously.

### AI Engineer at Cloudside Technologies (3rd Job)

Currently, I'm an AI engineer at Cloudside Technologies (which got acquired by Searce). Here, I build AI solutions for various clients using Google's cloud and AI services. I've worked on some interesting projects - like an LLM-based entity extraction system that pulls information from complex site plans and architecture diagrams with roughly 92% accuracy. I've also implemented multi-agentic solutions using Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit). One was a Text-to-SQL agent for querying different layers of log files to identify failure points. Another was a dual-agent system where one agent acts as a conversational assistant helping employees navigate workplace challenges, while the other analyzes those conversations to extract psychographic traits.

The team here isn't particularly mature - they lack communication and organizational skills. I've been mentoring them, helping them develop good practices around writing and maintaining code, guiding them to improve professionally. My efforts were recognized when I was awarded 'Best Employee of the Quarter - Q2 2025' for my contributions to the work, team, and company.

The organization has a great culture and environment. Everything is peaceful, which should be ideal, right? But here's the thing - I personally believe too much peace spoils growth as a professional. The projects I've worked on here haven't required much effort. I feel like I've rested enough. I need something more challenging, more intense, a place where things move fast.

## How I Work

I have my own unique way of approaching things (though maybe it's not that unique). Before I start doing anything, I think. I think deeply and for a long time about the approach I'll take to do something elegantly and efficiently. Then I list out the steps and start executing, always tackling the hardest tasks first. Usually, those hard tasks involve laying the foundation that allows me to iterate faster later. I keep track of tasks and their progress so I can pause and continue work freely. I do slack off when I get bored. Can't help it.

## Tools and Stack

I'm always adopting tools that enhance my productivity and help me work faster and better. [Zed](https://zed.dev/) is my default IDE. For Python projects, I use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). AI coding agents have massively enhanced my speed of execution and extended my axis of discovery - [Factory](https://factory.ai/), [Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush), [Warp](https://warp.dev/), and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) are among my favorites. I use [Mammouth](https://mammouth.ai/) to chat with different LLMs in one place, though not that often.

## Future Aspirations

As for my technical expertise, I have strong fundamentals in building scalable backend systems with AI at the core. I've built everything from web apps to backend servers, scaled them to handle heavy traffic, and created meaningful business impact. I'm experienced with multi-agent systems, particularly with Google's ADK, and I'm comfortable with end-to-end ownership from code to deployment. My focus has always been on backend and AI, though I've dabbled in mobile and other stacks too.

## Where I'm Headed

Looking at the near future and the current state of AI, I want to help companies build AI agents and automations, helping them become AI-native. My value proposition lies in backend + AI contributions. I have those strong fundamentals in scalable backend systems with AI at the core. Moving forward, though, I want to transform into a systems programming role and bring AI into the orchestration layer at the low-level of systems. I thrive in high-intensity, fast-paced environments where people are constantly developing and shipping in a loop.

There's also this dream project constantly on my mind - building a college through something called Tiny Leap. My theory is simple: as humans, we're capable of learning and achieving anything by ourselves. We just need the right environment with a great curriculum, resources and tools, a strong peer/mentor network, and ample opportunities to leverage our learning.

## Views on AI and Life

I have an optimistic view of AI. I believe it can be a force for good and help solve some of the world's biggest problems. It's already changing how we consume information and interact with digital devices. AI could potentially end the curse of addictive social media, giving us back time that's been stolen by these apps. It can unhook us and let us focus on what matters most.

That said, privacy is a major concern. We need to be mindful of what we share digitally because these organizations are data-hungry. The more they know about you, the more they can keep you hooked. We need to be aware of our interactions with AI. I believe humans and AI can happily co-exist in a world where people are digitally and technologically mature.

Beyond being a software engineer, I think a lot about life as a human being. I try to understand the reasons behind life and suffering, the purpose of existence, and ways to have fun. I mentor people to help them become better in their lives. I'm definitely not an expert in any of these things, but I do my best to understand and share my thoughts with others.

## Love (Life Partner)

I've recently met the love of my life. She isn't the woman of my dreams, but she's more than I could have asked for in a wife. She's beautiful - she can be gorgeous. She's so progressive and never stops talking. She's cute.
